#Mboacare Documentation

This page will guide you through the necessary steps needed to setup your development environment for the Mboacare App on a Window PC. For Mac computers you can find the equivalent setup procedure by googling.

## 1. Setup a GitHub Account
If you don't already have a Github account, we can create one by following the steps below.

* Click on Sign up
* Follow the instructions to create and account it involves providing an email address, username and password
* Open a web browser and visit [Github](https://github.com/)

## 2. Install Git 
Our next step is to install Git. Git is version control tool that tracks changes to our code files on our computers.

* You can download git for windows from the [Git Download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* After downloading Git the next step will be to run the downloaded stepup file. 
* To check if Git installed successfully, Open a command prompt window and type

  ``` git --version ``` press ``` Enter ``` from your keyboard

If you see an output similar to the screenshot above then git was successfully installed.

## 3. Install Flutter SDK
Flutter is cross platform UI framework on which Mboacare is built on hence inorder to run Mboacare development environment we need to setup the flutter development environment

* The flutter team has provided simple [guide to installing the flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) 
* After installing flutter you can open a command prompt window and type 

``` flutter --version ```

If you see an output similar to the screenshot above then flutter was successfully installed

## 4. Install an IDE (Intergrated Development Environment)
The next step after installing flutter will be to install an Intergrated Development Environment. The most common are Android Studion and Visual Studio Code. I usually prefer installing both.

* You can download the [latest Visual Studio code release](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Follow same process to install Dart extension

* You can download the [latest Android Studio release](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwie18r319iBAxXKi2gJHZHFBAMYABAAGgJ3Zg&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1OmoBhDXARIsAAAYGSG3udihx4f1BVV5XeSEabD9HN4T--qKqCQntTVRsxf6RBZEhDRESuUaAqPgEALw_wcB&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESVuD26-E7vK7m8Xu5bvm6zQl96aA8U9oToxoNqA8Fds5BbdD5kkEVI7NgsMobYBLxcGEknZktp9AUhaTE5sidytBHB2mYqOO-z32RNYVMqtbvRuAykFTo&sig=AOD64_1VeHsWC0upgYBovHc2v_NBTIeUdw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwiYvcX319iBAxXWU6QEHcHwDC8Q0Qx6BAgGEAE)

The next step After downloading Andriod Studio will be to install the flutter and dart plugin for Android Studio

Lastly Search for dart and install

## 5. Clone the "December 2023 to March 2024 Applicants" Repository
To clone the Repository we need to [visit project repository](https://github.com/AnishaSingh0118/Mboacare)

* The first thing to do will be to click on ``` Fork ``` inorder to create a copy of the code
