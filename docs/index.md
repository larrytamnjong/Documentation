The lack of information in today’s age posses a serious threat to life and increases mortality rate. Hospitals globally offer treatment of various diseases, however, information regarding which hospital can treat a patient of what, and where is it located is a major challenge to both health personnels and patients themselves. This project is to connect hospitals so as to share resources and information as per the services they offer. Treatment of patients can be much more facilitated and referral process made easy given hospitals are able to know which hospitals offer which services and in which location. This will reduce mortality rate, as not only hospitals but patients can search which hospitals offer treatment for which diseases, and the various locations globally.

The objective is to develop an open source application where hospitals can sign up, and register the various facilities and services as per their location, and other hospitals can easily refer patients, or patients can easily locate a hospital for each case. This saves time, and money and most importantly, reduces mortality rate.
